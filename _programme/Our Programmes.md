Whether you’re a foodie looking for greener dishes, or a parent who wants the whole family to have fun without waste, Go Green SG has something for you.

A plethora of green activities await this July. Green tours will introduce you to our island like never before, from ecological marvels to sustainable technologies, or get hands-on with sustainable workshops and learn how to recycle, upcycle and reuse. Indulge the shopping impulse at farmers markets and fairs, or satisfy your thirst for knowledge at panel discussions and seminars. And family has a special place - check out the range of kid-friendly learning opportunities outdoors, in school, and at home!

Spoiled for choice? Look below for weekly highlights, where we have picked out activities you absolutely cannot miss in the calendar below. Or just scroll the sidebar on the left for the full list of planet-friendly picks for your next outing. The full calendar is also available on our social media pages.

There’s something for everyone, so you can always Go Green, Your Way!
