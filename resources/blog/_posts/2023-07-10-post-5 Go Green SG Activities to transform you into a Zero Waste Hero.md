**Date**: 1 - 31 July
<br><br>
Food packaging is a major contributor of packaging waste in Singapore, making up almost 50% of all packaging waste. The good news is that we can help change that by bringing our own containers out for takeaways!
<br><br>
In July, Metta Café, a social enterprise that provides opportunities for youth with special needs, is offering a 10% discount on all takeaway hot beverages and meals when you bring your own mug or container.
<br><br>
On top of that, SaladStop is also on board the BYO train this July. Customers who bring their own containers will be rewarded with a free standard salad topping, or an 80 cents discount for beverages.
<br><br>
These deals are a great way to support the eco cause while reducing the use of single-use disposables.
