**Date**: 1 - 31 July
<br><br>
Food packaging is a major contributor of packaging waste in Singapore, making up almost 50% of all packaging waste. The good news is that we can help change that by bringing our own containers out for takeaways!
<br><br>
In July, Metta Café, a social enterprise that provides opportunities for youth with special needs, is offering a 10% discount on all takeaway hot beverages and meals when you bring your own mug or container.
<br><br>
On top of that, SaladStop is also on board the BYO train this July. Customers who bring their own containers will be rewarded with a free standard salad topping, or an 80 cents discount for beverages.
<br><br>
These deals are a great way to support the eco cause while reducing the use of single-use disposables.

In addition to the exhibition, the SMG also offers a behind-the-scenes look at how LTA plans, designs, and builds our land transport system. Visitors can learn about the challenges and opportunities of creating a sustainable land transport system, and how LTA is using technology to make our transportation system more efficient, liveable, and inclusive.
