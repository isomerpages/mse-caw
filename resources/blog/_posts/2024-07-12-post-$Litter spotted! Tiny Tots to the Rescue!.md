<p>You’re never too young to keep Singapore clean and green!</p>
<p>On 28 June, 20 preschoolers from PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Punggol Coast
Blk 402, together with their parents and guardians, participated in “Tiny
Hands, Big Hearts," an initiative by the preschool to raise environmental
awareness through family bonding and hands-on learning.</p>
<p>This is one of the 360 activities conducted by partners during Go Green
SG to raise awareness about environmental sustainability and public hygiene.
Beyond public activities, organisations such as PCF Sparkletots have also
organised internal-facing activities to engage their own stakeholders on
the importance of keeping Singapore clean and green.</p>

clean up some litter!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The teachers briefed the preschoolers and their parents about the litter
picking activity and how to sort the litter into recyclables and non-recyclables.</p>
<p>Under the adults’ supervision, the preschoolers helped clean up the Northshore
Straitsview Playground, picking up litter such as tissue paper and food
packaging.</p>

<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Identifying recyclables and non-recyclables is
part of building environmental awareness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To pique the preschoolers’ curiousity about the natural environment, the
preschoolers did some detective work in the next activity, I SPY, where
they were handed pictures of flora and fauna to identify around the area.</p>
<p>Keeping with the theme of environmental protection, the importance of
upcycling was reinforced through an arts and crafts activity.</p>

<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tapping into artistic expression to show care for
the environment. Recycled materials were used in the craft.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To conclude the event, parents and children were invited to contribute
pledges to protect the environment, which were pasted onto a pledge tree.</p>

the litter picking activity. Omar participated in the event with his mother,
Ms Ayu (far right).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ms Kate Corum, the teacher behind this outreach event, expressed hope
that the children would learn to show respect for the environment through
their actions and grow up to become responsible citizens.</p>
<p>Believing that children should learn through hands-on activities, Ms Corum
shared that litter picking was a good activity to engage preschoolers as
it was interactive and educational. It would also make learning about environmental
protection memorable.</p>
<p>Ms Ayu, mother of three-year-old preschooler Omar, felt that the litter
picking activity was meaningful as parents and their children could work
together to keep the environment clean. She expressed hope that Omar would
learn to be environmentally responsible and not to litter.</p>

<p>“Tiny Hands, Big Hearts” was an initiative in inspiring young children
to be champions for environmental cleanliness at an early age. With everyone’s
effort, our future generations can continue to grow and thrive in a clean
and green Singapore.</p>
