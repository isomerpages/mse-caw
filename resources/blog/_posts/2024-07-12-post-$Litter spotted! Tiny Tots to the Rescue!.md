<p>You’re never too young to keep Singapore clean and green!</p>
<p>On 28 June, 20 preschoolers from PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Punggol Coast
Blk 402, together with their parents and guardians, participated in “Tiny
Hands, Big Hearts," an initiative by the preschool to raise environmental
awareness through family bonding and hands-on learning.</p>
<p>This is one of the 360 activities conducted by partners during Go Green
SG to raise awareness about environmental sustainability and public hygiene.
Beyond public activities, organisations such as PCF Sparkletots have also
organised internal-facing activities to engage their own stakeholders on
the importance of keeping Singapore clean and green.</p>
