<p>With 2024 designated as the Year of Public Hygiene, activities centred
around public cleanliness were a key feature of Go Green SG 2024.</p>
<p>Besides public clean-ups, partners also organised smaller-scale clean-ups
within their own communities. One of these was NetWalking, which brought
together advocates from Singapore’s biodiversity and sustainability communities.
Held on 6 Jul 2024 at East Coast Park, NetWalking was co-organised by LepakInSG
(a local environmental group that organises activities to raise action
and awareness on environmental issues) and Stridy (a not-for-profit organisation
that focuses on waste management issues) to promote a platform for cross-pollination
of environmental ideas.</p>
<p>Wesley Teng, a Raffles Junior College student and one of the participants,
appreciated that the clean-up event also encouraged environmental discussion.
“When people see [others] working together to help Singapore, it helps
motivate them to keep Singapore clean as well. When public events like
this [happen], it helps to build awareness so that other people can start
their own clean-ups,”</p>
<p>Not only did NetWalking help keep the environment clean, but it also “[helped]
people to connect with the environment around them”, Wesley shared.</p>

<p>Cigarette butts made up the bulk of the litter collected during the activity.
Yasser Amin, Chief Stridy Officer, Stridy, educated participants on the
fact that cigarette filters are constructed of cellulose acetate, which
is non-biodegradable. He also emphasised the importance of using different
techniques for removing various types of environmental litter so that clean-ups
can be as efficient as possible.</p>
<p>Oviya Namo, a Singapore Institute of Technology aerospace engineering
student, who took part in the event despite the hot weather, remarked that
there was also an additional significance to the event to remind people
to do their part for climate change.</p>

<p>Participants ended the activity on a positive note. After a discussion,
participants shared their thoughts on the future of Long Island, hoping
that it would achieve the goals of coastal protection, while providing
a conducive environment for biodiversity conservation and recreation activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Exchanging ideas for a sustainable Singapore</p>
<p>Oviya further added, “Go Green SG is all about awareness and getting the
general environmental knowledge out to the public. I’m happy to see that
Singaporeans are actually interested in going for these initiatives all
around Singapore!”</p>
