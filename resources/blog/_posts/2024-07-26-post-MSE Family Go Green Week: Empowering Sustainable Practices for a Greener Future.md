Go Green SG is a yearly, nationwide movement to rally citizens, organisations, and the community to take action towards a more environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient Singapore. In support of the movement, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) also held its own Go Green Week for MSE family officers from 8 – 12 July, with various activities aimed at promoting environmental awareness and sustainable practices among officers from MSE, National Environment Agency (NEA), Public Utilities Board (PUB) and Singapore Food Agency (SFA).

**Sustainability Fair**<br>
Go Green Week kicked off with a Sustainability Fair on 8 July, graced by Minister Grace Fu and Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor. The fair aimed to rally our officers to support key green messages – Reduce Waste, Save Water, Save Energy, and Buy Local Produce.

Lining the foyer of the Environment Building was a showcase of green initiatives by local farmers, environmental organisations, and Government agencies. Officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) showed how they upcycled their old uniforms and fire extinguishers into useful items such as card holders and tissue box holders. SCDF also shared that their donations of old fire hoses to the Singapore Zoo made great enrichment toys for the animals.

Officers attending the fair could also try their hand at making their very own upcycled plastic carabiner with Plastify’s injector machine. The machine works by melting the shredded plastic, then moulding it into various items, such as carabiners or coasters.

Farmers from the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation (SAFEF) also saw brisk business selling their fresh local vegetables, fishes, and eggs, with many customers quickly snapping up their stock.

As tokens of appreciation, our booth partners were presented upcycled coasters made by Plastify. It was a meaningful morning where we witnessed the various efforts by our partners and the MSE Family as we work towards sustainability.

**Kallang River Cleanup**<br>
Go Green Week continued with an invigorating kayaking and pedal boat water cleanup event at the Kallang River on 9 July, in partnership with Waterways Watch Society (WWS), a volunteer group promoting the protection of Singapore’s waterways. To kick off the event, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng addressed MSE family participants, thanking them for walking the talk to maintain a clean environment. WWS representatives followed on with a briefing on the importance of clean water as well as the efforts that have been put in place to maintain the river over the years.
 
Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng and participants set out on the river in kayaks and pedal boats, navigating as a group to collect litter. The sight of otter families thriving amidst the clean waters was a heartening reminder of the positive impact of such initiatives.

The weather was perfect for the activity, with clear skies and a gentle breeze. Within two hours, participants managed to collect a total of 27 kg of litter, including snack packaging, plastic bottles, straws, and other items. To conclude the activity, the participants together with WWS representatives helped clean the kayaks.

**Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm Tour**<br>
Another highlight of Go Green Week was a tour of Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm, a pioneering project in Singapore's renewable energy landscape, on 11 July. Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon kicked off the tour by reminding participants about the importance of solar energy in mitigating climate change and reducing our carbon footprint. Representatives from Sembcorp followed with a briefing about the technical aspects of the solar farm project.

The Tengeh Floating Solar Farm, consisting of 122,000 solar panels, is the first and largest of its kind in Singapore, able to generate electricity to power approximately 16,000 four-room HDB flats! This significant contribution is a step towards achieving Singapore's net-zero emissions goal.

The briefing also touched on the advanced technology behind the solar panels, which were developed through research to ensure efficiency in Singapore's tropical climate, as well as minimise any negative impact on surrounding wildlife.
Following the briefing, participants embarked on a boat tour around the solar farm and observed the innovative solar panels up close. Participants were provided with a more in-depth understanding of renewable energy and the large-scale efforts being made towards a greener future.

That’s not all! MSE Family officers also took part in other learning journeys, such as to NEA’s Mosquito Production Facility and SFA’s Marine Aquaculture Centre.

As Go Green Week concludes, it is essential to carry forward the lessons and inspiration gained from these activities. Every small effort counts in our collective journey towards a sustainable future. Let us continue to take proactive steps in our daily lives, embrace eco-friendly practices and support initiatives that promote environmental conservation. Together, we can create a greener, cleaner, and more sustainable Singapore for future generations!
