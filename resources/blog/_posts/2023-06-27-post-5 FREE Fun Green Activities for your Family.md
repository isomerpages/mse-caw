D2L.sg is a non-profit organisation that aims to reduce food waste by recovering food items from F&amp;B businesses and redistributing excess food to organisations, low-income families, and other beneficiaries. This surplus food - which would otherwise be discarded, is then redistributed through the GoodHood.sg app, a mobile application that allows Singaporeans to connect with their neighbours to give, help, and share.
<br><br>
Volunteer by signing up on their website to help with the collection and redistribution of food, as well as with other activities such as marketing and fundraising. Companies can also indicate their interest to be a part of this meaningful movement by signing up on the website. Sign up as a volunteer [here](https://www.gogreen.gov.sg/wanted-food-rescue-volunteers-to-help-redistribute-surplus-food/).
