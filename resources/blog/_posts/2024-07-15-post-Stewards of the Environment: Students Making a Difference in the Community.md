The second week of Go Green SG 2024 capped off with the “Adopt a Block” initiative, piloted by the Ministry of Education in polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).

Launched by Second Minister for Education, Dr Maliki Osman, at Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) on 29 June, the initiative aims to empower youths from polytechnics and ITE to be change-makers in their community and increase awareness and support for sustainability. 


In this year-long initiative, students from each polytechnic and ITE college will “adopt” three residential blocks near their campuses. They will engage residents at least once a month through workshops and visits to encourage them to reduce their water and electricity consumption, as well as increase recycling and greening efforts. 

For example, 30 NYP students engaged Teck Ghee residents during the launch on upcycling and recycling efforts, and will be encouraging greening in their community through tree planting and community gardens.

In the spirit of the Go Green SG movement, stakeholders across the Public Service have stepped forward to support this initiative too. Grassroots organisations under the People’s Association will help out with engagement efforts, while 31 Public Service officers will also be working with students to develop and strategise community outreach methods, accompany students on household visits, and participate in community events run by the various institutions.

The launch event of “Adopt a Block” was attended by over 400 residents, students and staff from polytechnics and ITEs and public service officers from various agencies. The event featured a showcase of sustainability-related booths from students and alumni. 

The booth “Project Green Gifts” involved the distribution of vegetables grown by NYP to the local community. Students who participated in “Project Green Gifts” leart about growing vegetables in an urban setting, using technology to minimise manpower while maximising output. The process of growing vegetables also helped students understand the challenges associated with food production. 

Additionally, another booth named “The Thrift Market” employed principles of freecycling to redistribute pre-loved but usable items to others who may find good use for them. NYP students organise this market annually to promote a circular economy and reduce waste generation. During the Adopt a Block launch event, more than 500 pieces of clothing and 100 miscellaneous items such as kitchenware, toys, and bags were successfully redistributed, thus extending the lifespan of those items.

Students are looking forward to doing their part too. “I hope that this [initiative] would [encourage residents to] incorporate [waste reduction habits] into their lives, [and help them understand] that they don’t really need to buy new items ”, Year 3 NYP student, Lee Quan Yao, shared.
