Go Green SG is back this year! Thanks to the strong support of over 180 partners, MSE has curated more than 360 activities for everyone to learn about how we can build a cleaner, greener and more climate-resilient Singapore, and take collective action. In addition to activities that are open to the public, partners also organised smaller-scale activities to engage their own communities. These activities also go a long way in encouraging more to adopt sustainable living!

One such example is the Climate Workshop on 16 June 2024, organised by Ismaili CIVIC, Henderson-Dawson Green Action for Communities (HDGAC) under Henderson-Dawson CCC and City Sprouts. 20 Henderson-Dawson residents tried their hand at card games that aimed to share insights into climate change and resource management challenges, and cultivate a sense of environmental stewardship. The participants were split into two groups, with one experiencing the Climate Fresk Workshop, and the other trying their hand at the Circular Economy Collage.

Climate Fresk is an interactive workshop designed to educate and raise awareness about climate change. Guided by workshop facilitators, the Henderson-Dawson residents used 42 cards to explore different aspects of climate change and gain insights into the complexity of climate science. For example, did you know that sea ice melting does not make the sea level rise, just like how melting ice cubes do not make a glass of water overflow?

The Climate Fresk cards also has a version for kids, which has simpler phrasing and relies on pictures, rather than graphs. The two youngest participants, Antarak and Vibhr, both six years old, had an exciting time learning about climate change!

The Circular Economy Collage is a hands-on workshop that invites participants to consider the impacts of a linear economic model of take-make-use-throw and explore a circular model which focuses on sustainable development. Participants also brainstormed ways to shift towards a more sustainable circular economy, such as adjusting food portion sizes.

Participants shared post-session that they were “amazed to see the feedback and interconnection between different cards” and expressed hope in making the world a better place. 

**Strengthening sustainability initiatives through partnerships** <br>
In support of Go Green SG 2024, a series of activities were organised for Henderson-Dawson residents in partnership with Henderson-Dawson Green Action for Communities (HDGAC) under Henderson-Dawson CCC. In addition to the Climate Workshop, residents took part in the Mobile Community Composting Drive, which was co-organised with National Environment Agency (NEA), supported by Tanjong Pagar Town Council and other community partners such as City Sprouts and Ecosami. The Composting Drive comprised two parts: a collection drive and a compost celebration. During the collection drive, volunteers collected 152kg of kitchen waste from over 60 households, and organic waste such as fruits and egg shells from the Bukit Merah wet market, fruit wholesaler and hawker stalls.

<div style="text-align:center">Contaminants such as plastic packaging can spoil the compost, so it is important to remove them.</div>

Residents’ Networks took this opportunity to reach out and spread awareness regarding the composting process. Residents expressed interest to adopt composting at the community or household level. At various locations, children were also involved in the weighing and recording of collected kitchen waste!

On 6 July, residents will be invited to City Sprouts, where the composting bins are, to witness the compost process.   

A tree planting session was also organised at Holland Road as part of the OneMillionTrees Movement, where participants contributed towards efforts to transform Singapore into a City in Nature.
