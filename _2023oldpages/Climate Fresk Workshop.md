**Check out Climate Fresk, a fun and collaborative workshop to raise awareness about climate change with over 230 facilitators in Singapore working with schools/companies across the region.**

**Organiser:** Climate Fresk Singapore

The Climate Fresk is a science-based workshop that aims to educate and raise awareness about climate change worldwide. Based on the IPCC report, the workshop will explain how and why the climate changes at the current pace and the consequences of its disruption.

The workshop is based on a 42-card game. Each card represents a topic, a cause or a consequence of climate change. Guided by a facilitator, participants will form teams to find the cause-effect relationship among the different aspects of climate change. This step-by-step collage provides keys to understand the complexity and develop a strong understanding of the science.

The workshop's programme is as follows:
- A Brief History Of "The Climate Fresk" workshop
- Icebreaker
- Construction of the Climate Fresk guided by your facilitator
- A short break (if needed)
- Creative phase
- Debrief + time to share, express thoughts and feelings
