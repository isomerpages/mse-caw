**An immersive, privately-guided, multi-venue experiential tour into Singapore’s heartlands. Deep dive into the wet market on a hunt for green ‘waste’ and transform them into useful compost.**

**Organiser:** Tribe Pte Ltd

What is Singapore doing to ensure and secure our food supply? What role can you play to strengthen our food supply resilience? 

This exclusive tour will bring you for a deep dive into the Clementi heartlands to explore the sustainability efforts within our wet markets and provide a unique experience to forage for vegetable waste and ugly food.
 
Next, we go behind the scenes at a research institute to learn about compost. A ground-up initiative managed by volunteers, work alongside them and embark on a one-of-a-kind hands-on experience to transform your collected vegetable waste into compost!.

Tour is suitable for all ages, families and couples!
