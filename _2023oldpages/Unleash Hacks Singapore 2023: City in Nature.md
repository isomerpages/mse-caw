The UNLEASH Hacks are sprint-like innovation processes where young people come together over a short period of time to collaborate, ideate, design, rapidly prototype, and pitch their solutions to a sustainability challenge. 

UNLEASH's fourth edition of the hack in Singapore will focus on biodiversity and understanding of the 'City in Nature' concept to explore the impact of urbanisation on life on land and life below water.
