**Organiser:** National Parks Board

Come and be amazed by the Rainforest at the Gardens, one of the oldest remnants of primary forest in Singapore.

Some 314 species of plant jostle for space in this precious six-hectare fragment of primary tropical forest, forming a multi-layered ecosystem of herbs and ferns, climbers, shrubs, and trees. Some trees reach 50 metres in height and were here even before the founding of modern Singapore in 1819.

Among the rich species of plants found in the Rain Forest are trees of economic importance, such as rattans, fruit trees and the towering Jelutong. With more than 50 per cent of its species representing plants that are rare in Singapore, the Rainforest certainly qualifies as an important part of Singapore’s natural heritage.

This tour is recommended for 6 years old and above. No pets are allowed.

Registration is required in-person at Nassim Visitor Services Desk by 8:45 am. Limited slots per session on a first-come-first-served basis.
