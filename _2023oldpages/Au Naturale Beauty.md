With Semakau Landfill reaching its limits, how can we reduce the amount of waste we produce, and avoid sending unnecessary waste to the landfill? 

In this workshop, participants will be taken through a series of workshops on zero waste beauty. The workshops focus on:

- DIY Natural Detergents: Make enzymes from fruit peels that are usually thrown out. The peels can be turned into a laundry detergent, pest control for plants and cleaning agents that are not harmful to skin and pets.
- DIY Natural Scrubs: Our beauty routine is important to us. However, it uses a lot of unnecessary plastic and ingredients that may be harmful to nature and people. From plastic toothbrushes that can't be recycled to scrubs with microplastics, our daily routine has an impact on the environment and our landfill.

Participants will learn about alternatives to daily-use products that may be harmful to nature. Participants will also learn how to make natural scrubs and hair masks with ingredients you can find in your kitchen.
