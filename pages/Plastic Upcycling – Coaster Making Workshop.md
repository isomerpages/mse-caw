Turn High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) plastic waste - which is commonly found in milk bottles, bottle caps, and detergent bottles - into functional items like coasters. 

Learn about the importance of recycling and environmental sustainability, how to identify what can be recycled and how to recycle them right. 

The workshop aims to show participants how every one of us can do our part to help mitigate climate change.
