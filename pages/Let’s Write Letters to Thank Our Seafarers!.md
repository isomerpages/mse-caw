Join "Seafarer: The Heroes of the Sea!" - a captivating parent-and-child workshop series conducted by Singapore Maritime Gallery (SMG) volunteers.&nbsp;

Designed for children aged 12 and below, this interactive event aims to educate and inspire the next generation about the vital role of seafarers in maritime operations. Participants will have the opportunity to create letters from recycled materials such as old magazines, newspapers, and accessories, which will be displayed at the PlayPort – a children's area of the gallery - until the end of June 2024. This activity is not only a showcase of children's creativity, it also serves as a public awareness initiative for the upcoming Day of the Seafarer on 25th June 2024.&nbsp;

By participating in this workshop, children and their parents can gain a deeper appreciation for the unsung heroes of the sea and the importance of sustainable practices. It is a chance for families to bond over a meaningful activity while learning about the maritime industry and contributing to a public exhibition. Don't miss this opportunity to engage in a fun and educational experience that celebrates the invaluable contributions of seafarers and promotes environmental consciousness. Sign up now and be part of this enriching event!
