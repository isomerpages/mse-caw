**Join us for the launch of the Bounce Bag Point at Dawson Road! Contribute or take a reusable bag from this Bounce Bag Point before shopping.**

Date: 03 July - 31 July<br>
Admission: N/A<br>
Venue: 85 Dawson Road<br>
Organiser:  Tanjong Pagar Town Council 

Bounce Bag Point is a community initiative by Tanjong Pagar Town Council (TPTC) to share reusable bags. 
  
To encourage shoppers to adopt more sustainable habits like bringing their own bags and reducing the use of disposable and plastic bags, TPTC is working with Plastic Lite SG to install Bounce Bag Points at strategic locations in town. Members of the public can give or take a free bag from the station. 
  
TPTC will launch a new Bounce Bag Point at Blk 85 Dawson Road (outside Sheng Siong supermarket) in support of Go Green SG.
