**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>
**Venue:** Pasir Ris Park Area 1<br>
**Organiser:** Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS)

"Clean the seas with SEAS" is an effort aimed at tackling ocean pollution and promoting environmental sustainability. Participants will come together to clean up a designated area of the beach, removing litter and debris that pose threats to marine life and ecosystems. &nbsp;

In addition to the beach clean-up, the event will also include a discussion about marine conservation and clean energy technologies as well as booths featuring sustainable products.

Volunteers can play a part in reducing plastic pollution, safeguarding marine biodiversity, and promoting sustainable living practices. Moreover, participants will have the chance to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations passionate about environmental stewardship.  &nbsp;

Environmental enthusiasts, families, corporate groups and the general public are all welcome to join and make an impact
