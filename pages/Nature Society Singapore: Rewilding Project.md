![Participants of a rewilding project](/images/Initiatives/Nature_society_rewilding.jpg)

**Date:** 29 June, 9:00 am â€“ 12:00 pm<br>
**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>
**Venue:** Rail Corridor (opposite Jalan Bumbong)<br>
**Organiser:** Nature Society Singapore<br>

Looking for an opportunity to show some appreciation to our environment? Join Nature Society Singapore (NSS) at the NSS Rewilding Project to make the Rail Corridor a greener place! 

You will be involved in the rewilding activity, which includes manual clearance of grass and weeds, followed by a tree planting along the Rail Corridor. The aim of this project is to shape the Rail Corridor as a conduit for plants and wildlife and to provide continuous canopy cover.

Participants need to be physically fit (e.g., be able to lift at least 10kg and withstand the hot sun outdoors) and be well on the event day. NSS reserves the right to turn away participants who are unwell on the day.
