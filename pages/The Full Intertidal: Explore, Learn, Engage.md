**Immerse in the rich marine biodiversity, take part in a beach cleanup, and wrap up with a hands-on intertidal artifacts session!**

**Date:** 4 July, 4:30 – 6:30 am | 5 July, 5:30 – 7:30 am | 6 July, 6:00  – 8:00 am | 7 July, 6:30 – 8:30 am | 8 July, 7:30 – 9:30 am | 9 July, 9:00 – 11:00 am | 20 July, 6:00 – 8:00 am | 21 July, 6:30 – 8:30 am | 22 July, 7:00 – 9:00 am<br>
**Admission:** Adult: $71 | Child: $37 <br>
**Venue:** Changi Beach<br>
**Organiser:** The Untamed Paths

Participants will be introduced to the intertidal environment and the rich marine biodiversity, including how marine critters have shown resilience via their repopulation of the reclaimed Changi Beach stretch. 

Following the exploration, participants will be led on beach clean-up. This will lead into a facilitated discussion about what gets washed up on the beach, and the importance of ongoing efforts to manage waste and increase uptake of reusables. 

To wrap up the experience, there will be a hands-on segment about intertidal artefacts (shells, moults, skulls) that are also washed ashore along with marine litter.
