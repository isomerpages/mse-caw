**Date:** 23 June, 8:00 am - 11:00 am  <br> 
**Admission:** $38/pax <br> 
**Venue:** Pulau Ubin <br> 
**Organiser:** Loris &amp; Owl  

Join a jaunt to Pulau Ubin to explore the island from its lowest to highest point in this Shore to Hill Walk. Ubin’s rocky shore is home to Purple Climber Crabs, Mudskippers, Hermit Crabs and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

As you head inland, admire the majestic flights of the White-bellied Sea-Eagle and Brahminy Kite and be serenaded by the trio of famous songsters – the Straw-headed Bulbul, White-rumped Shama and Oriental Magpie Robin. You will drop by the scenic Pekan Quarry for its Grey Heron colony, and pass through the mangroves to observe the cute antics of the Blue-spotted Mudskipper. A telescope enables close\-up views of glorious garden birds such as the Olive-backed Sunbird and Oriental Pied Hornbill. The final stop is a climb up the 74-metre Puaka Hill for a bird’s eye view of Ubin Quarry and Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Reward yourself with a relaxing coconut drink in Ubin Village before catching a ferry back to Changi.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Please prepare an extra $8/pax to pay to the boatman directly for a round trip boat ride to Pulau Ubin.
