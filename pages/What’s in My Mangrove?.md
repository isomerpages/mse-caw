Did you know that more than 30 mangrove species can be found at Sungei Buloh?&nbsp;

The mangrove habitat, which occurs between the land and sea, poses a challenging environment for plants and animals to survive. Mangrove plants have to adapt to live through the constant flooding, high salt content and soils with poor oxygen levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;
