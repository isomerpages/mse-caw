**Discover our urban farm in Redhill estate. Learn aquaponics, hydroponics, composting, and biogas benefits. Take home a microgreen kit. Experience sustainable farming in just one visit!**

Date: 7, 8, 21, 22 July, 9:30 - 10:45 am<br>
Admission: $30 per person<br>
Venue: CitySprouts, 102 Henderson Road<br>
Organiser: CitySprouts

Hidden along the Henderson estate is a city urban farm that used to be a school. Come join us on a journey around the farm and learn about various techniques that are used such as aquaponics, hydroponics and even mushrooms.  Participants get to see the difference between the traditional farming, for example, on rice paddies, and the newer techniques that use less land and resources. 

 As Singapore's landfill slowly reaches capacity, we need to think about how to reduce waste. The tour will introduce easy composting methods and biogas composting. Biogas composting helps reduce the amount of methane (in the case of open air composting) and the methane is then reused for cooking thus closing the loop.  
 
Lastly, participants will bring home their own microgreen DIY Kit and learn about the benefits of microgreens! (PS: No cooking required, just grow and toss them into salads!)
