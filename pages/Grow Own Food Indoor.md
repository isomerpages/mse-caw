Introducing Indoor Vertical Aquaponics, a farming technique used to grow vegetables and fish. Being a self-circulatory ecosystem, the output from fish is converted to nutrients for the vegetables, which in turn clear the water for the fish.&nbsp;

With Singapore University of Social Sciences’ prototypes, explore 
- how aquaponics can contribute to food security, 
- how a team of students (ABCM)’s formulated juice with home-grown fruits and vegetables is different from other juices, and 
- how vegetables for Leicha grown from indoor aquaponic methods are more value-for-money than purchasing them outside.&nbsp;

Make a $10 donation before the activity to secure your spot! All proceeds will go towards the SUSS Student Care Fund.
