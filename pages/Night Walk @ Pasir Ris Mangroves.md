**Admission:** $38/pax<br>
**Venue:** Pasir Ris Mangroves<br>
**Organiser:** Loris &amp; Owl

Join this unforgettable night walk to Pasir Ris Mangroves &amp; Park to experience the exciting wildlife that begin their day when others sleep. Spot Dog-faced Water Snakes on the hunt for fishes, while the high tide could invite Puffer Fishes, Longfin Snake-eels and Horseshoe Crabs into the heart of the mangrove forest. Charming Tree-Climbing Crabs, Giant Mudskippers and huge Telescopium Water Snails call the mangrove home. The bioluminescent twinkle of Mangrove Fireflies provides a magical touch. 

If you are lucky, you might encounter (from a safe distance) other snake species including the Mangrove Pit Viper, Oriental Whip Snake and Gerardâ€™s Water Snake! Under UV light, see plants, lichens and fungi fluoresce gorgeous shades of red, gold, yellow, blue and purple. Other possible sightings include various species of nightjars, owls, bats and frogs.
