This activity is a guided learning tour at Tzu-Chi Foundation’s interactive gallery, conducted by its eco volunteers. Through this learning journey, Tzu Chi volunteers will share about how individual and collective actions contribute to sustainability in three  key aspects – Environmental, Social and Economic. 

With real life examples, learn about the environmental costs of our lifestyle on Mother Earth. Pick up sustainable living habits and integrate into them your daily lives towards a sustainable future. 

Parents and children can learn to embrace sustainable living habits together and how they can be integrated into their daily lives. Back at home, family members can put what they learnt into practice and nudge each other towards sustainable choices to become a ‘Green Family' - a family united in their commitment to a sustainable future.

This activity is recommended for participants aged 10 and above.
