**Date:** 30 June, 10:30 am â€“ 3:30 pm<br>
**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>
**Venue:** Our Tampines Hub, 1 Tampines Walk, Central Plaza<br>
**Organiser:** SL2 Impact Ltd

Repair Kopitiam is a community gathering of repair coaches and the public who wish to learn how to fix their own items. Learn how to keep food appliances clean and well-maintained for improved hygiene and performance. 

If not properly cleaned, such food appliances can become breeding grounds for grease and food residue, affecting product heating performance. This can result in uneven cooking, wasted energy, and unhealthy consumption.

Participants will also be brought on a walk-about around Our Tampines Hub to experience how sustainable solutions are applied in practical ways. Experience firsthand how the mall reduces energy consumption, minimises its carbon footprint, conserves water, and processes food waste. 

The event provides a good opportunity for participants to learn and be inspired by real-world examples of sustainability in action.
