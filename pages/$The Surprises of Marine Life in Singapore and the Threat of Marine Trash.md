The marine environment continues to be threatened by habitat destruction, overfishing, pollution and marine trash. Particularly, marine trash like plastic bags and abandoned fishing nets kills marine life by ingestion, entanglement, suffocation and toxicity. 

Attend this online talk by speaker Sivasothi N, NUS Senior Lecturer and Fellow, as he shares stories about our precious marine life, and how plastic marine trash threatens them.

Learn how lifestyle changes and economic changes of urban populations will influence the production and consumption of single use consumer plastics and make a difference to protect our marine life. 

This programme is part of a series on sustainability co-curated with the NUS Department of Biological Sciences.
