Coco and Friends is a children’s programme aimed at raising understanding and awareness of Singapore’s native biodiversity found in our forests.

Through the eyes of Coco, the Malayan Colugo, children will embark on a nature adventure to learn about Coco and his forest friends, and the plants that are useful to both man and animals.

Each child will receive a Coco nature kit consisting of a creative and colourful nature journal, a set of crayons and a beautifully decorated sling bag.

The guided walk will be held around Hindhede Nature Park.

This programme is recommended for children aged 5 – 7 years old.
