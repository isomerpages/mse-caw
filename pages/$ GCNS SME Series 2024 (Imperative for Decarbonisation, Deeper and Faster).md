Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of Singapore’s economy, contributing significantly to economic activities. In light of climate change, SMEs play a pivotal role in accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, navigating the complexities of decarbonisation while managing day-to-day operations can be challenging for SMEs.

This session seeks to provide insights to Singapore’s decarbonisation goals and how SMEs can collaborate towards a shared vision of a low-carbon future, in alignment with the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Hear success stories from LowCarbon SG participants and be inspired to take action. This session also serves as a platform for SMEs to voice their views on decarbonisation and network among peers.&nbsp;

This activity is suitable for participants with mobility issues.
