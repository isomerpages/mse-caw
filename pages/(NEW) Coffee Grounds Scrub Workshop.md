Embrace the role of a sustainability advocate in your community and expand your knowledge through interactive, hands-on activities organized by The Sustainability Project. 

Singaporeans consumed 6 million kg of coffee in 2020. This is a big waste generator and there are many ways you can upcycle your used coffee grounds instead of throwing them away! Learn how to upcycle coffee grounds and use them for another purpose. Participants will take home 1 - 2 customised coffee ground body scrubs.
