Animals residing in the zoological parks of the Mandai Wildlife Reserve receive regular enrichment to keep them physically and mentally healthy. This hands-on workshop showcases Mandai Wildlife Group’s unique sustainable approach to creating fun and stimulating enrichment devices to boost animal welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Visit the Singapore Zoo’s Animal Playground, a play space that was created just for animals out of pre-loved items from around the parks. You will also create an enrichment device for an animal, and learn to reduce waste by reusing unwanted items for a new purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Separate admission charges to Singapore Zoo applies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This activity is suitable for participants aged 6 and above, and participants with mobility issues.
