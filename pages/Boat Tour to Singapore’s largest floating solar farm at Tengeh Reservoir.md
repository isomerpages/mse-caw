With water demand projected to almost double by 2065, Singapore’s energy needs will increase as we rely more on weather-resilient yet energy-intensive sources of water – NEWater and desalinated water. A key strategy to manage our energy use is increasing renewable energy production through the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on our land installations and reservoirs.  

PUB is helping Singapore achieve its national solar target of at least two gigawatt peak (GWp) by 2030, by investing in solar deployment to green its operations and using clean energy to produce clean water. 

Through this tour, participants will learn about PUB’s efforts to harness solar energy, and produce each drop of clean tap water at the turn of a tap in a sustainable manner.

This tour is exclusively for Singapore citizens, permanent residents, and holders of ICA-approved and MOM-approved passes with a valid FIN number, including holders of employment pass, student pass, work permit, or dependent pass. 
This tour is only open to visitors who are 18 years old and above.
