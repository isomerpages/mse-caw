Coco and Friends is a children’s programme aimed at raising understanding and awareness of Singapore’s native biodiversity found in our forests. 

Through the eyes of Coco the Malayan Colugo, children will embark on a nature adventure learning about Coco and his forest friends, and the plants that are useful to both man and animals. 

Each child will receive a Coco nature kit consisting of a creative and colourful nature journal, a set of crayons and a beautifully decorated sling bag. 

The guided walk will be held around Hindhede Nature Park.
 
This programme is recommended for children from 5 – 7 years old.
