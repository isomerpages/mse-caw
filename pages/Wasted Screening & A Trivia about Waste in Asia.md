Wasted is Eco-Business's latest impact documentary. It was first launched in Singapore and Dubai in the run up to the United Nations climate change COP28 meeting in December 2023.

This film screening will open your eyes to the simple truth: What is thrown away, doesn’t go away. Everything that is consumed has a lifespan that is never seen. Waste has an inextricable connection to daily lives and the well-being of societies. 

After the screening, enjoy a fun and engaging trivia session about the key challenges and solutions for waste management in Asia. 

This activity is suitable for people with mobility issues.
