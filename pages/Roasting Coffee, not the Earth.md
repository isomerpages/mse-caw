Many people rely on a strong brew to get through the day, but what does coffee have to do with wildlife conservation and climate change? 
In Southeast Asia, demand for kopi luwak – highly prized coffee made of cherries partially digested by civets – is threatening the welfare of these animals; while forests in many parts of the world are often razed to grow coffee plants. 
The good news is, there is a way to enjoy a cuppa joe without costing the Earth. At this event, learn about the link between biodiversity and climate crises, and the environmental impact of the cultivation and consumption of coffee. 
Participants will receive a $18 gift card that can be used at The Social Space outlets and a free cup of rainforest-friendly coffee.
