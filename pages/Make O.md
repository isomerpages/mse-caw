**Experience GINLEE's latest circular initiative - /\/\/\ake O, where you will be guided on how to customize your very own pleated bag or repurpose your unwanted t-shirts to create a Tee Bag that comes with specially printed 3D-handles.**

**Organiser:** GINLEE Studio

With its thoughtful design and sustainable production process, GINLEE’s _/\/\/\ake O workshop breaks through the noise in an industry saturated by fast fashion, to create a space for customers to reimagine how good design can reduce waste and transform the unwanted into unique products.
 
Under _/\/\/\ake O, you can choose to experience the _/\/\/\ake cOts Experience  or the Tee-tO-Bag Experience. At the _/\/\/\ake cOts Experience, base bags of a single colour are “coloured on the spot” on-demand, reducing inventory to one singular SKU and therefore cutting down on excess waste.
 
The _/\/\/\ake cOts Experience comes with pOcuts, utility pockets which are die-cut with a pre-designed template, salvaged from the offcuts to encourage a zero-waste design. These pockets can be easily snapped on and off with the 3D printed recycled filament for flexibility of placement, allowing for longer use. 

The Tee-tO-Bag Experience caters to customers keen to repurpose unwanted t-shirts into a Tee Bag for daily use. The bag handles are 3D-printed which allows for easier assembly and disassembly to ensure circularity.
  
The initiative hopes to promote appreciation for the design process and to allow more to experience the joy of recreating useful products from the unwanted through hands-on experiences.
