You will have the opportunity to play two new card games:
Sus Chef and Fact or Fiction (Energy Edition).&nbsp;&nbsp;

In "Sus Chef", take on the role of chefs and compete to put together ingredients to create Singapore’s iconic dishes in the fastest time possible! There’s a catch – your dishes must generate the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and food waste!&nbsp;&nbsp;

In "Fact or Fiction (Energy Edition)", a fraudster is scamming you with fictitious statements while a Greenwasher is making everything greener than it seems. But POFMA Officer, Auditor, and Whistleblower are on your side. Spot the signs and stop the Fraudster and Greenwasher before you are scammed and kicked out of the game while learning about energy sustainability and renewable energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

These activities are suitable for participants aged 10 and above. &nbsp;

While the activity is free, do note that usual Science Centre admission charges apply:<br>
* Child (ages 3 to 12): $4
* Adult: $6
* Senior Citizen (ages 60 and above): $4
* Existing members of the Science Centre will enjoy complimentary access.
