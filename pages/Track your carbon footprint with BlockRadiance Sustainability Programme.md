**Kickstart sustainable habits with the PlanetSustain app. Track your carbon footprint and identify ways to reduce it by practising responsible consumption and reducing energy usage.**

**Date:** 1 - 31 July<br>
**Organiser:** InvoSystems Solutions Pte Ltd

The programme utilises the PlanetSustain mobile app to: 
- Raise public awareness on climate change and sustainability, and educate individuals on tracking their personal carbon footprint.
- Assist employers and schools to track  the carbon footprint generated by their operations. This will enable them to identify areas where they can reduce their carbon emissions and become more sustainable.
- Encourage the public to incorporate sustainable practices into their daily routines, to support Singaporeâ€™s net zero goal.
