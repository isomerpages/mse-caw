**Date:** 28 June, 7:20 pm - 9:30 pm<br>
**Admission:** $38/pax<br>
**Venue:** Rail Corridor<br>
**Organiser:** Loris &amp; Owl

See the iconic Rail Corridor in a new light at night as it comes alive with charming nocturnal creatures. The natural stream here flows down from Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and hosts the Malayan Giant Frog, Common Walking Catfish, Lowland Freshwater Crab, Ghost Shrimp and various fish and frog species. The Common Palm Civet (‘Musang’) is a possible sighting, especially with the many Yellow Stem Fig trees providing a source of food. 

Under UV light, watch plants, fungi, lichens and insects fluoresce gorgeous shades of red, purple, yellow and blue. Other possible sightings include the shy Malayan Box Terrapin, the sinuous Asian Swamp Eel, the stunning Gold-ringed Cat Snake, the occasional Colugo, as well as owls, centipedes, fireflies, nightjars, and various bat species hunting or foraging in the cool nightscape.
