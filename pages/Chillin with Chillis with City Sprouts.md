Most Singaporeans enjoy the delicious taste of chilli, but are you aware of just how much you can do with it? Come with your family and learn how to turn leftover chillis into a pest spray that will help protect plants in a sustainable way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can also try your hand at turning those same chillis into a unique sambal which you can munch on as a family. Wrap up the session by shaking up a cold, refreshing chilli and lime mocktail.

Registration for July runs opens on 13 June, 10:00 am.
