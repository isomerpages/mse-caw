**Learn more about the findings from Gardens by the Bay’s pilot study on carbon storage of ponds and potential of “blue” carbon sequestration by urban mangroves!**

**Date:** 20 July,  9:00 – 10:00 am<br>
**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>
**Venue:** Waterview Room, Gardens by the Bay<br>
**Organiser:** Gardens by the Bay

Conducted by consultants from DHI Water and Environment, the talk will share the results and lessons learnt from one year of monitoring the carbon sequestration of mangroves and urban wetlands.

This project is the first study in Singapore to explore the potential for carbon sequestration in urban wetlands, by leveraging the Garden’s Kingfisher Wetlands as a living laboratory. Kingfisher Wetlands acts as a testbed for new climate solutions, while promoting biodiversity and engaging visitors on sustainability. This project is conducted in partnership with the private sector and academia for City in Nature and supported by Temasek and SG EcoFund. 

The results pave way for exploration of the best way to maximise the potential of man-made wetlands for long-term carbon storage, which could potentially be scaled up for use in other parts of Singapore or other cities. 

Hear from researchers from the NUS Centre for Nature-based Solutions as they share about their study on the changes in the carbon content of abandoned aquaculture ponds that were restored into mangrove habitats at Pulau Ubin. Attendees will also get to attend a free guided walk at Kingfisher Wetlands after the talk. As there are limited slots for the free guided walk, participation will be on a on first-come, first-served basis.
