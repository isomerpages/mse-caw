With Pulau Semakau reaching its limits, how can we reduce the amount of waste we produce, and avoid sending unnecessary waste to landfills? Participants will be taken through a series of workshops held in a farm focused zero waste beauty. The workshops focus on:

- DIY Natural Detergents: Make enzymes from fruit peels that are usually thrown out. The peels can be turned into a laundry detergent, pest control for plants and cleaning agents, that are not harmful to skin and pets.
- DIY Natural Scrubs&nbsp;Our beauty routine is important to us. However, it uses a lot of unnecessary plastic and ingredients that are harmful to nature and people. From plastic toothbrushes that can't be recycled to scrubs with microplastics, our daily routine requires a lot from the environment and our landfills.

Participants will see alternatives to daily-use products that are currently harmful to nature. We will show them how to make natural scrubs and hair masks with ingredients you can find in your kitchen.
