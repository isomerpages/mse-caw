**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>

**Organiser:** NUS Toddycats 

The Lim Chu Kang Nature Park is part of the Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, which buffers the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve to the west of the Reserve.  

This wetland habitat strengthens the conservation of wetland biodiversity of the Reserve and the overall biodiversity in the northwestern part of Singapore.  

Join NUS Toddycats in a meaningful exercise to plant native trees suitable to the area.
