**Join D2L.sg as a volunteer to recover and distribute rescued items so that they are put to a much better use than the bin, digester, composter or recycler. Learn how D2L.sg optimises the matching of items for the best and highest use via technology! Establishments with surplus food can also indicate their interest to be a part of this meaningful movement.**

**Organiser:** Divert for 2nd Life (D2L.sg)
