Singapore’s used water network is designed to collect and convey used water and not waste, oil and grease.&nbsp;

Learn what common materials choke our sewage systems, and do your part to keep public and private sewers free-flowing to minimise public health issues. Witness a manhole inspection and demonstration of how sewer chokes are cleared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Visit the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant which treats used water that flows through the sewage system from the central and western areas of Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Learn about the various stages of the water treatment process and visit the biosolids treatment facility where sewage sludge (a by-product of used water treatment) is digested in egg-shaped digesters!&nbsp;
