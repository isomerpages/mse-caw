Embark on an unforgettable night adventure suitable for all ages, with the enchanting native Malayan Colugos stealing the show.

In the field with The Untamed Paths' wildlife guides, peek into the secretive lives of the nocturnal creatures found in Singapore's green spaces.  As Singapore is usually not associated with having lots of wildlife - this will be an exciting experience to observe the flying colugos (or flying lemurs) in action!

Experienced naturalist facilitators will guide you as you delve into the intricacies of the rainforest ecosystem, and witness the intrinsic beauty of local biodiversity. This immersive experience also offers the possibility of encountering delightful surprises such as small brown tarantulas, roosting whip snakes, dwarf bark scorpions, sunda scops owl, lowland freshwater crabs, common palm civets, and many more!
