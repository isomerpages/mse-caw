Worried about food security? Curious about how technology can help Singapore become an agricultural hub in the region despite our limited space and resources? Join our workshop and a tour to the SUSS Experiential Urban Farm to find out more! 

The Director of Nutrious Farms, the industrial partner of SUSS developing Agri-Preneur Incubation Programme and set up the Experiential Urban Farm, will be sharing on Singapore's 30 by 30 vision and strategies, different farming systems and automated technologies. Through the workshop and farm tour, participants will gain a better understanding of the local agriculture industry’s efforts to strengthen food security.
