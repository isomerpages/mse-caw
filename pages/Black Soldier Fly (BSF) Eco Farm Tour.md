Learn how the docile Black Soldier Fly (BSF) uses its magic to turn trash into treasure, and provide a solution to food waste. Understand the various stages of the BSF's life cycle, and how it can play an important role in creating a more sustainable future for all. In addition, participants will visit a community farm, help fertilise plants with BSF frass, and feed both fish and quails with BSF larvae.  

The eco farm tour is designed for both adults and children. Children aged 6 and below must be accompanied by parents.  (Accompanying adults would require an admission ticket as well.)

Registration for the 13 July session opens from end-June to mid-July.
