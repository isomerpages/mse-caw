**Venue:** Choa Chu Kang Public Library <br>
**Organiser:** National Library Board 

Inspired by the nearby farms in Choa Chu Kang, Lim Chu Kang and Kranji, the design of the library steers towards the theme of nature and greenery. Green and wood tones are used, and special features include a tree-like structure in the children's section. The library was recognised as the Best Green Library in the world by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) in 2022 and is the first public library to house a hydroponics showcase, where workshops are conducted to foster interest in urban farming solutions. 
Patrons can also experience immersive content by scanning QR codes around the library with their mobile phones on the library’s augmented-reality learning trail.
