**Let your kids come and scour our urban farm and discover sustainable practices. Enjoy interactive upcycling activities and take part in a fun scavenger hunt.**

**Date:** 15, 29 July, 9:00 - 10:15 am<br>
**Admission:** $22<br>
**Venue:** City Sprouts, 102 Henderson Road<br>
**Organiser:** City Sprouts

A special edition just for the kids! In this kids-friendly workshop, kids and parents can have a fun family day together, going through various sustainable workshops. 

The workshops will be held at different stations on the farm and kids can also take part in a scavenger hunt around the farm. Through the hunt, they will learn about local plants, sustainable ecosystem, composting and food security. 

Each participant will have the opportunity to plant their own seeds that they can take home and watch it bloom. The hunt will end with an upcycling cereal box robot show-and-tell that is interactive and engaging for both parents and kids.

We hope kids will take home these eco learnings and help remind their parents to keep up the sustainable practices.
