Organiser: National Parks Board

The OneMillionTrees movement is a nationwide effort to plant a million more trees across Singapore between 2020 and 2030. 2023 marks 60 years of greening Singapore since founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew launched our first nationwide tree-planting campaign in 1963 by planting a Mempat tree at Farrer Circus. 

Join us in our tree planting efforts in Singaporeâ€™s streetscapes, gardens, parks and park connectors, nature reserves and nature parks. Together, we can transform Singapore into a City in Nature for future generations to enjoy!
