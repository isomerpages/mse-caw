Join us at the Sustainable · Pets · Arts "S.P.A." event at South Beach, where we celebrate the pets, arts, and sustainability all in one.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of our daily routines, we often unknowingly contribute to environmental damage and landfills. The event focuses on Zero Waste Movement, which aims to minimize waste through the implementation of the 5 R's.

At our event, we will showcase various lifestyle alternatives and pets product alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't miss our Green Glam Up interactive workshop, where we promote eco-literacy regarding beauty waste and its impact on landfills. During the workshop, we will guide participants through the process of making their own body scrub and hair mask, using natural ingredients that are kind to both the skin and the environment.
