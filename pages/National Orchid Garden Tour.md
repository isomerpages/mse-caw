Since 1859, orchids have been closely associated with the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The products of the Gardens’ orchid breeding programme, which began in 1928, deserve a place where they can be displayed in their full splendour.

With over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids on display at the National Orchid Garden, these gorgeous blooms are an absolute sight to behold.

This tour is recommended for participants above 9 years old and suitable for individuals with mobility issues. No pets are allowed.

Registration is required by 8.45am at the Ticketing Counter of National Orchid Garden. Limited slots are available on a first-come-first-served basis.
