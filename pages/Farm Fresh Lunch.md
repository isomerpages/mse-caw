Join City Sprouts as they delve into the importance of sustainability and demystify the concept of a vegan-diet. 

As we witness the rise of alternative protein options in markets and restaurants, it's crucial to understand the implications of animal derivatives and their toll on our limited land resources. 

By adopting more vegan and vegetarian dishes into our daily meals, we can make a positive impact on the environment and biodiversity, while also embracing a healthier lifestyle.

During the tour, participants will have the opportunity to engage in an express farm tour and hands-on harvesting experience. A chef will also guide you through simple steps to create vegan dishes. This workshop is specifically designed to assist those who are curious about the transitioning to a vegan diet but may feel uncertain about where to begin.

By attending our workshop, you will gain valuable insights on the culinary world of the vegan diet, understand how easy preparation can be, and unlock the secrets to crafting delectable vegan meals.
