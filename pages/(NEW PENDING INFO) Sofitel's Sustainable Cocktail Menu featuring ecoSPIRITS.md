**Raise a toast to positive impact with cocktails using ecoSPIRITS infused with upcycled herbs and fruit waste.**

**Date:** 1 - 31 July<br>
**Admission:** $20++ per glass<br>
**Venue:** LeBar, Sofitel Singapore Sentosa<br>
**Organiser:** Sentosa Development Corporation

LeBar will be incorporating spirits packaged using the ecoSPIRITS system in all their in-house cocktails. 

ecoSPIRITS is an innovative closed-loop distribution system that nearly eliminates packaging waste in the premium spirits supply chain. By dramatically reducing packaging and transport costs, ecoSPIRITS provides both a powerful cost advantage and a transformative carbon footprint reduction.

For the month of July, LeBar will featured two sustainable cocktails concocted by Head of Mixologist, Daniel Anthony:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

* The Urban Decay: Jackfruit seed infused gin, orange skin and black lemons

* Carbon Eclipse: Rosemary stem tequila, sauteed pineapple core, mango juice, egg white
