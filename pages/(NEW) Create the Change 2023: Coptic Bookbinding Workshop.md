This workshop will be guided by craftspeople with disabilities who have been honing their skills in the traditional art of book binding for over 30 years.   

One of two workshops centered around sustainability, which will provide a hands-on experience and engagement for participants. Learn directly from local designers about the techniques used to make sustainable items.
