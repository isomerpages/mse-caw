Organiser: The Untamed Paths

Join this exciting night tour of Pasir Ris Park, the only other protected mangrove forest in Singapore aside from its more famous counterpart, Sungei Buloh. Once you step onto the boardwalk into the mangrove forest, you'll get to discover mangrove inhabitants such as horseshoe crabs, vinegar crabs, mudskippers, and various water snakes (at a safe distance of course!). Students can apply what they see and learn during this tour to their science curriculum back in school (on different ecosystems and adaptation)!
 
More importantly, participants will learn about the intrinsic beauty and value of local biodiversity, and need to conserve the spaces that harbor this biodiversity.
