**Date:** 16 June, 8:00 am - 10:15 am  <br> 
**Admission:** $38/pax <br> 
**Venue:** Thomson Nature Park <br> 
**Organiser:** Loris &amp; Owl  

Thomson Nature Park and its environs host a stellar cast of fabulous forest denizens. The star attraction here is the rare Raffles’ Banded Langur, a leaf-chomping primate that regularly makes acrobatic leaps between trees.

Other resident mammals include cheeky Long-tailed Macaques, Wild Pigs, as well as cute Slender and Plantain Squirrels.

Attractive forest birds such as the Greater Racquet-tailed Drongo with its dramatic tail feathers, Crimson Sunbird, Emerald Dove, Red-crowned Barbet, as well as various species of parakeets and woodpeckers may be seen. Reptiles are mostly well-hidden and it takes a keen eye to spot them. These include the Clouded Monitor Lizard, Green-crested Lizard, Sumatran Draco (flying dragon) and elusive forest snakes such as the Wagler’s Pit Viper, Twin-barred Tree Snake and Gold-ringed Cat Snake.

As a bonus, you will pass through the ruins of the former Hainan Village for a feel of rural life in the 1960s. Join an exciting morning walk to seek out these forest treasures!
