Get ready for a relaxing evening of wine and chilli! 

No, your eyes aren't playing tricks on you! During this event, you will be served natural wines, not with cheese, but with chilli! Surprise your senses by being guided through a tasting of natural wines, paired with a range of sambals prepared with fresh chillis. 

You can even make your own sambal blend and pair it with bruschetta toasts.
