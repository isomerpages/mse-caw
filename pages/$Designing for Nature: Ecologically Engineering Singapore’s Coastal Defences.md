Coastal urbanisation and climate change are driving the global spread of artificial coastal defences. While these structures may help protect against rising sea levels, they have significant effects on the ecology of marine habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Ecological engineering – the integration of ecological principles and engineering for the benefit of both humans and nature – is a form of nature-based solution that is being increasingly adopted to improve the ecological functioning of coastal defences and alleviate its negative impacts. How can we incorporate habitat complexity and green elements into new coastal defence designs, and at larger scales? Sign up now and hear from speaker Peter Todd* on what the potential defences and their additional benefits are!<br>

*About the Speaker<br>
Peter Todd is an associate professor at the National University of Singapore where he runs the Experimental Marine Ecology Laboratory. He aims to increase understanding of the ecology and functioning of tropical urban coastal systems. His interdisciplinary research  synthesises elements of biology, geography, and engineering to answer ecological questions. Dr Todd's lab has 20 years of experience in the conceptualisation, building, implementation, and analysis of novel experiments, and over a decade designing and testing a wide range of seawall biodiversity enhancements. With over 200 scientific papers published, his findings contribute towards both fundamental knowledge as well as generating nature-based solutions for urgent conservation and environmental challenges.
This programme is part of a series on sustainability co-curated with the NUS Department of Biological Sciences.
