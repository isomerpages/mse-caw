Did you know that food waste accounts for about 12 per cent of the total waste generated in Singapore? In 2021, we generated 817,000 tonnes of food waste, which is equivalent to 56,000 double-decker buses! 

Find out how we can turn food waste into something useful and reduce the amount of waste we send to Semakau Landfill! Learn about  the food waste collection processes at  hawker centres, and how food waste is processed and turned into fertilisers for community garden. Participants will get to bring home fertiliser made from food waste to use on their own plants.
