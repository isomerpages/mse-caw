Embark on an exciting intertidal journey that will ignite your adventurous spirit like never before! This walk is a rare opportunity for participants to get up close with marine life that is often overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Discover a hidden world under the sea - as the tide retreats, observe a mesmerising underwater world comprising echinoderms, crustaceans, clams and different species of fish. Observe closely as sand gobies and swimmer crabs scurry away with the waves. As you tread carefully on the seagrass meadows, observe the agile hermit crabs scurrying across the sand, their shells serving as a shield against predators.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Learn basic coastal ecology and discover the intricate behaviours of these often–underestimated marine creatures. Following the guided exploration, teams will be led in a short direct action beach cleanup.&nbsp;
