Led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Go Green SG (formerly known as Climate Action Week) is a whole-of-nation movement to rally the community to take collective action towards a sustainable future for Singapore. It comprises a series of sustainability-related events and activities in July organised by our 3P partners.

This year, in collaboration with the Singapore Tourism Board, we are showcasing various sustainable experiences that Singapore has to offer as a sustainable urban destination.

You can curate your own Go Green experiences, based on individual lifestyles, personal interests and goals. With sustainability tours, events, workshops, school and youth activities, promotions and green challenges, everyone can go green in your own way.

Letâ€™s work together in achieving our shared vision of a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore!
