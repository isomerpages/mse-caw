A fun and interactive talk brought to you by online vegan grocer GoodFoodPeople. GoodFoodPeople's accredited nutritionist will explain what a plant-based diet is and its associated health and environmental benefits. 
Learn where to find essential nutrients, and the pros and cons of plant-based protein products. Participants will have the opportunity to sample some plant-based meat alternatives, and enjoy their very own vegan bowl after the talk. 

This is a great opportunity to understand the need to start thinking about the choice of food, and how diet not only impacts health but also the planet.
