Smooth and sticky, sharp and rough, fluted and furry – feel some examples of different textures that plants have evolved on the surfaces of their trunks, leaves, roots, fruits, and flowers to survive and thrive!&nbsp;

Join guides on a tactile journey through the outdoor gardens to learn about plants with fascinating forms and textures and how they relate to the sense of touch.

This 1-hour activity involves walking in the outdoor gardens. Gardens by the Bay is wheelchair- accessible.
