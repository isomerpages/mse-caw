**Venue:** South Beach Fountain Plaza<br>
**Organiser:** Climate Fresk Singapore

The Climate Fresk is a science-based workshop that aims to educate and raise awareness about climate change worldwide.
Based on the IPCC report, the workshop will explain how and why the climate changes at the current pace and the consequences of its disruption.<br>

How the game works: The workshop is based on a 42-card game. Each card represents a topic, a cause or a consequence of climate change.
As a team, guided by a facilitator, participants are to find the cause-effect relationship between the different components of climate change. Collective intelligence will get participants from one deck of cards to the next! This step-by-step collage provides keys to understand the complexity and develop a strong understanding of the science.

The workshopâ€™s program:
- A Brief History Of "The Climate Fresk" workshop
- Icebreaker
- Construction of the Climate Fresk guided by your facilitator
- A short break (if needed)
- Creative phase
- Debrief + time to share, express thoughts and feelings
