Aquaponics is a system that combines aquaculture (raising fish) with hydroponics (growing plants in water). 

Learn about aquaponic systems, the nitrogen cycle, symbiotic relationships between fish and plants, as well as system design. 

Harvest both fish and plants from the system, and come up with ideas for utilising produce! 

Discuss the environmental benefits of aquaponics over traditional farming. You will also get to experience a mesmerising dancing fish show and get a delightful serving of spinach ice cream!
