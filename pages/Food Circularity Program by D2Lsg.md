The Food Circularity Program offers a transformative experience to tackle Singapore's food waste through education, hands-on engagement, and community empowerment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Participants can join an educational session conducted virtually on Zoom to gain insights into the environmental, social, and economic impacts of food waste, and learn sustainable management practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Participants can also register for an additional hands-on, experiential session held at Pullman Hill Street to witness first-hand food rescue and redistribution processes, fostering a deeper understanding of the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This activity is suitable for participants with mobility issues.
