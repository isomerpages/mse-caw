This is a scavenger hunt game to raise awareness of climate change.

Get transported to the year 2060 and step into a very different Singapore. You and your team will compete and collaborate with others, navigate Singapore to hunt and scavenge precious resources, meet with the last few suppliers left in the country and face multiple catastrophes along the way. Will you collect enough resources? Will you... survive the collapse? 

After the game, meet the other teams and debrief strategies over some well-deserved drinks. Forge new connections and relish the spirit of unity that emerges from this gripping experience. Get ready to learn a great deal about the planet and environmental challenges that must be confronted.

Children under age 14 must be accompanied by a paying adult.
