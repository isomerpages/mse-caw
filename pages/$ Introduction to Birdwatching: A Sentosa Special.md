Ever wondered what birds you can find on a small island such as Sentosa? In this tour, learn to identify local avian fauna by their appearance and unique calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Bring along your adventurous spirit as you embark on a trail among tall rainforest trees skirting along the coastline. Equipped with a pair of binoculars and a guide sheet, you will be observing and listening to interesting avian fauna in their homes. This walk provides you with the opportunity to immerse yourself in nature while getting acquainted with some of the avian cohabitants and learning the ropes of ‘birding’ (e.g., how to spot and identify common birds using a pair of binoculars)!&nbsp;
