Reduce waste through upcycling with the Tee-tO\-Bag Experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Bring along and repurpose your outgrown and old tees! Transform them into an all-new Tee Bag which you can carry around daily.

Kids can also take part in the upcycling process by using off-cuts from tees to create little bag charms, and placing cut-out letters onto the bags with help from GINLEE Studio. 

This activity is recommended for those 5 years old and above.
