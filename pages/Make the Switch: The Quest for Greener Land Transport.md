Discover how small changes in our transport habits can make a huge difference in our fight against climate change. Complete a series of ‘quests’ to learn how Singapore’s land transport system is going green and make a pledge to do your part for a sustainable land transport future.
Explore the main Gallery too for a behind-the-scenes look at how LTA plans, designs and builds our land transport system while balancing efficiency, liveability and inclusivity as it leverages technology for smarter urban mobility. See you there!
