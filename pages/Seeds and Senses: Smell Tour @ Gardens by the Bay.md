Here is your chance to stop and smell the flowers, fruits, and leaves! Journey with guides through the World of Plants gardens to meet some of its most aromatic residents.&nbsp;

On the way, you will discover more about your sense of smell and how plants produce and use scents (both fragrant and foetid) to communicate, protect themselves, and attract animals to do their bidding!

This 1-hour activity involves walking in the outdoor gardens. Gardens by the Bay is wheelchair-accessible.

Registration for the July runs opens on 13 June, 10:00 am.
