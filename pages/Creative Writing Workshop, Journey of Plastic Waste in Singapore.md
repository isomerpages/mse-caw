**Date:** 13 July, 3:00 pm – 4:30 pm<br> 
**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br> 
**Venue:** Heartbeat @ Bedok, 11 Bedok North Street 1<br> 
**Organisers:** EB Impact and City Developments Limited

 
This creative writing workshop is for children aged 9 to 13 years old and it will be hosted by Dorcas Tang, a children’s book illustrator and author. EB Impact Ambassadors will also facilitate this workshop.&nbsp;

Envision a world where the waste that surrounds us can speak and make friends. Join Poly, a single-use plastic bottle, on her journey and discover who she encounters. If she lands into the sea, what will her fate be?&nbsp;&nbsp;

What to expect:&nbsp;

*   Crafting the protagonist: We will start by crafting the personality and appearance of the protagonist, Poly, together.&nbsp;
    
*   Brainstorming: Let's use our imagination! Where might a plastic bottle travel to in Singapore? What sights might it see? Who might it meet (friendly or not-so-friendly)?&nbsp;
    
*   Building the plot: Work with one another to build a climax and ending, focusing on the plastic bottle's emotions and experiences.&nbsp;
    
*   Sharing: Hear the stories of other groups and learn about the different journeys the plastic bottle can take in Singapore.
