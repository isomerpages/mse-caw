In this behind-the-scenes vertical farm tour, understand the constraints land-scarce Singapore faces in the agriculture sector, and its strategies for sustainability.

See how Sustenir brings to life its signature salads such as Kinky Kale and Toscano Kale inside its farms. Learn about the challenges of growing greens using technology, try your hand at harvesting, and sample the freshest salads. Learn about the benefits of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), and how it can improve health and moods, address sleeplessness, and tackle stress in cities.

Each participant will be given a goodie bag (worth $25) and will get to enjoy a tasting session of Sustenir’s produce and smoothies.

This activity is recommended for participants who are above 12 years old.
