Step away from digital screens and into rooms full of imagination with Theatre Jams!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Conducted by professional theatre practitioners, Theatre Jam is an informal theatre activity where players improvise and respond to theatre-based stimuli, picking up inspirations to present a colourful array of artistic human expressions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This edition of Theatre Jam invites young participants to come together to create stories in response to nature-based stimuli, in a safe and playful environment together!&nbsp;

Programme Outline:&nbsp;<br>
1. Jam preparation - prepare "ingredients"&nbsp;<br>
With your sense of sight, smell, hearing, and touch, explore and embody the elements of nature.
2. Put "ingredients" together to make jam&nbsp; <br>
With the movement and sounds gathered, create and tell your stories.
3. Pack jam into jars&nbsp;<br>
Recollect and notate the stories through drawings or writings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

These notes and sketches will be slipped into jam jars and made into jam recipes for the participants.&nbsp;

The session on 15 June is recommended for children between the ages of 5 and 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The session on 22 June is recommended for children between the ages of 7 and 9.
