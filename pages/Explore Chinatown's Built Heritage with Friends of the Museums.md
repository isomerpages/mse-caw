Join a two-hour walking tour of the historic district of Chinatown led by docents from the Friends of the Museums, and delve into the area’s architectural, cultural, and social history.&nbsp;

Choose from four tour routes, each covering a distinctive precinct: Bukit Pasoh, Kreta Ayer, Tanjong Pagar and Telok Ayer. See firsthand how our built heritage adds character to the streetscape, contributing to the creation of a city that is distinctive, sustainable and endearing. Learn about Singapore’s award-winning conservation programme and gain a better appreciation of the efforts to balance different land needs in our small island city-state.&nbsp;

These Chinatown Heritage Trails are a collaborative initiative between the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Friends of the Museums. Friends of the Museums is a volunteer, non-profit society devoted to offering guiding services and financial support to Singapore’s museums and cultural institutions as well as delivering programmes to enhance the community’s knowledge of Asia’s history, culture and art.

This activity is suitable for individuals with mobility issues.
