Join The Transmutation Principle in this two-part event to learn about climate change and how it impacts the elderly! 

The Climate Fresk is a science-based workshop that aims to educate and raise awareness about climate change. It is used in over 150 countries to deliver quality education on the climate crisis in communities, companies, schools, universities and institutions. 

This fun, hands-on and thought-provoking workshop  explains how and why the climate changes at the current pace and the consequences of its disruption.

In the panel discussion thereafter, find out how climate change affects our elderly and the eldercare industry/caretakers. Learn about issues such as inclusivity of elderly in the climate conversation and how to build community support for elders, a vulnerable population especially due to the health-related risks of a changing climate. 


Panel Speakers:
* Ms Fauzia Amalia, Red Cross Singapore,
*	Adam Reutens-Tan, The Community Foundation of Singapore
*	Ms. Karen Wee, Lions Befrienders Singapore
*	Moderated by Akbar Makani, Ismaili CIVIC

This activity is recommended for caregivers, professionals in healthcare and/or elderly-related industries, and family members. This activity is also suitable for participants with mobility issues.
