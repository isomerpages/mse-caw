Heron Watch is a citizen science initiative by NParks to get Singaporeans involved in collecting valuable information about the herons, egrets and bitterns across Singapore.&nbsp;

For one morning or afternoon from 13 â€“ 21 July, volunteers will survey one of the designated sites across Singapore. The data collected from the survey offers an opportunity for long term monitoring of native biodiversity in Singapore. This information will help to inform conservation efforts and strategies.&nbsp;

Training will be provided for volunteers who are new to Heron Watch. New volunteers can sign up for their preferred training slot (29 or 30 June). Training will be held at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.
