**Organiser:** Apeiron Bioenergy and Tanjong Pagar Town Council

Join Apeiron Bioenergy and Tanjong Pagar Town Council as they launch Singapore's first-ever used cooking oil recycling point for households and learn how to dispose of your own used cooking oil responsibly.&nbsp;

Attend an interactive talk and observe the proper way of disposing used cooking oil and the detrimental effects of improper disposal.

Participants are encouraged to bring their own used cooking oil for recycling. Simply pour the cooled oil into a bottle, screw the cap on tightly, and drop it off at the designated recycling point at Our Green Hub.
