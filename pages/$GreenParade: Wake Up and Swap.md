Join GreenSpace+ for GreenParade, a fun-filled event promoting sustainability and eco-friendly living, with activities such as talks on climate action, interactive workshops and a live concert. 

Bring your own Tshirts to upcycle and personalise them with vinyl stickers containing sustainability-related messages. There will also be plenty of swap opportunities â€“ Swap music with like-minded people, swap plants to promote less waste, and swap your upcycled Tshirts. Through food education sessions by social enterprise MoNo, learn about the differences between best-before dates and expiry dates. 

This activity is recommended for anyone interested in sustainability, including eco-conscious individuals and families, students, educators, and community leaders.
