**Date:** 6 July, 8:00 am - 10:30 am <br>
**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>
**Venue:** Resting Hut (Rail Corridor - North  Buona Vista) <br>
**Organiser:** NUS Toddycats

The Rail Corridor is a unique green space that serves as a haven for diverse flora and fauna species and provides a crucial migration pathway for wildlife. 

This connectivity is essential for genetic diversity and the long-term survival of species. Efforts to reintroduce native plant species and create suitable environments are underway.  

To augment the habitat enhancement works along the Rail Corridor South, join NUS Toddycats to undertake sapling protection works. Sapling protection helps to reduce the stress on newly-planted saplings and enhance their survivability until they take root.
