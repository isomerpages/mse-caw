Smooth and sticky, sharp and rough, fluted and furry – feel some examples of different textures that plants have evolved on the surfaces of their trunks, leaves, roots, fruits, and flowers to survive and thrive!&nbsp;

Join guides on a tactile journey through the outdoor gardens to learn about plants with fascinating forms and textures and how they relate to the sense of touch.

This 1-hour activity involves walking in the outdoor gardens. Gardens by the Bay is wheelchair- accessible.

Registration for the July runs opens on 5 or 13 June, 9.00 am or 10.00 am
