Admission: Free (registration required)<br>
Venue: Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay<br>

From vertical greens that reach up to the sky, to underground spaces hundreds of metres deep, Singapore had to be creative in using our limited land space. With brilliant foresight, our city planners have designed Marina Bay to be the model for sustainable and liveable cities around the world. Learn about how Singapore can continue to remain a city of the future with deliberate urban planning and what we can do as citizens to contribute towards making Singapore one of the best cities to live in. Through the sustainability puzzle hunt, participants will be able to appreciate the complexities and challenges of designing an urban city that is sustainable and vibrant, especially with Singapore’s limited land space as well as recognize the efforts places into the greening of Singapore, why this is important and what the future plans are for growing Singapore’s reputation as a City in a Garden.
