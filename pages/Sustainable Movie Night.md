Films on the Farm is a signature event at Sky Sprouts where you can enjoy outdoor screenings in an intimate and open air setting.

For Go Green SG month in July, special documentaries or movies with sustainability themes will be screened. Topics covered include global warming, food security and food alternatives, zero waste living, etc.

The movie screening will be accompanied with healthy and sustainable snacks and drinks. It's a great way to kick back and relax, while still learning about green spaces in the city and getting to know all the benefits and opportunities that a rooftop farm can give.
