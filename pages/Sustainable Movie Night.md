Films on the Farm is a signature event at Sky Sprouts and this week, we will be screening a curated movie in the theme of Go Green SG. 

Join us in a an intimate setting, open air environment with a&nbsp; green and natural environment. Normally we play movies that are well-known or linked to a social theme. For Climate Action Week, we plan to screen special documentaries or a movie that revolve around themes of sustainability. Each documentary will have a theme, such as global warming, food security and food alternatives, zero waste living, etc.

This will be accompanied with healthy, sustainable snacks and drinks. It's a great way to kick back and relax, while still learning about green spaces in the city and getting to know all the benefits and opportunities that a rooftop farm can give.
