Since the facility began operating in 2021, Abraclean has been diverting glass waste away from Semakau Landfill. By March 2024, Abraclean plans to recycle 3,500 tonnes of glass waste, enough to fill up seven Olympic-sized swimming pools. The tour will show how Abraclean converts trash to treasure and supports Singapore’s journey towards becoming a zero-waste nation.
