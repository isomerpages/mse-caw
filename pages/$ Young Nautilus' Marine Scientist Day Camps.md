It’s a Go Green June holiday! Join the Marine Scientist Day Camp and embark on a journey of discovery as a family!

Battle against marine trash and take action to protect the ocean in a coastal clean-up. Unravel the mysteries of marine life as you delve into a hands-on squid dissection experience, explore the fascinating world of intertidal ecosystems and discover the wonders hidden within our shores. 

Don't miss out on this opportunity to become a marine scientist for a day!
