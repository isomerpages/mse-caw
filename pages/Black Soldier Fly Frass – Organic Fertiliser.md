**Date:** 12 June – 14 July<br>
**Organiser:** Otolith Enrichment  

This organic fertiliser is produced and harvested in Sustainability @ Tampines Park, Singapore’s first and biggest community-based circular ecosystem for sustainable food waste management and food production.   

This project demonstrates circularity within a residential area using the larvae of the Black Soldier Fly to upcycle food waste from the nearby residents and school. The larvae are then used as feed for the tilapia fish culture in the nearby pond, and the frass (excreta from the BSF larvae) is used as fertiliser to grow vegetables in the community farm.   

Order a packet of this organic fertiliser and start growing fresh and healthy green veggies at home!
