**Venue:** Children’s Biodiversity Library by S.E.A. Aquarium, at the Central Public Library <br> 
**Organiser:** National Library Board

The Children’s Biodiversity Library by S.E.A. Aquarium is a partnership between the National Library Board, Singapore (NLB) and Resorts World Sentosa (RWS). It is the first marine-biodiversity themed learning space for children in a public library in Singapore, with the aim of inspiring love and action for marine biodiversity in children.

Stepping into the immersive space, children will immediately embark on an exciting journey of discovery and embrace the wonders of marine biodiversity through a diverse range of engaging and interactive features. These include a floor-to-ceiling column with coral-like features and accompanying infographics, a collection of marine specimens including shark egg cases and coral skeletons, digital content from the aquarium, an outdoor mangrove showcase in support of the mangrove repotting programmes conducted by RWS for children, and The Submarine, a dedicated space designed to resemble a submarine to immerse children in educational programmes. 

Located in the newly reopened Central Public Library, this space also houses a refreshed children’s collection comprising books and reading material. Patrons can also experience immersive content by scanning QR codes around the library with their mobile phones, on the library’s augmented-reality learning trail.
