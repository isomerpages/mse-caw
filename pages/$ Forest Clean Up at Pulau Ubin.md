**Date:** 29 June, 9:00 am – 1:00 pm<br>
**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>
**Venue:** Pulau Ubin<br>
**Organiser:** Nature Society Singapore<br>

The Forest Clean-up at Pulau Ubin aims to raise awareness about our impact on the environment and how we can make a difference through our daily habits. 

You will contribute to Nature Society Singapore’s (NSS) efforts to monitor ongoing littering trends on Pulau Ubin. Besides removing forest debris along the 2km route, you will also collect data as part of NSS’ monitoring programme. Data sheets and guidance on data collection will be provided.

The programme also features a learning journey to introduce the various concepts of conservation (invasive species, fragmentation, dependence of human on nature, etc.) as well as ways to be better stewards of nature (such as nature photography ethics, nature reserve and parks etiquette, effects of wildlife feeding, etc.)
