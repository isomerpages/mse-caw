From a critically endangered Sunda pangolin which became roadkill, to a paradise tree snake trapped in a plastic bag, countless wild animals have lost their lives to our urban environment and human activities. Join lens-based artist, Jasvic Lye, as she takes you through her journey of documenting the plight of Singapore's wildlife through photography and evocative stories in her years-long project entitled “Death by Man” and learn what we can do to prevent more animals from suffering the same unfortunate fate.
