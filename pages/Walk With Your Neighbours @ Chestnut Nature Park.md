**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>
**Venue:** Chestnut Nature Park<br>

Unfamiliar with Chestnut Nature Park? Don't fret!

Friends of Chestnut Nature Park present a free nature walk guided by residents of the area. Learn about the history of the park, including its plants and animals (some endangered!).

Bring your family and friends down to meet new friends — and if you're lucky, you may even get to meet a mousedeer!&nbsp;

As we will be exploring the park via hiking trails, the event is not suitable for participants with mobility issues.

This volunteer-run activity is a Friends of Chestnut Nature Park initiative supported by NParks.
