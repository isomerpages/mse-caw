**Admission:** Free (registration required) <br>
**Date:** Various<br>
**Venue:** Various<br>
**Organiser:** National Parks Board

Invasive species pose a threat to biodiversity. They compete for space, light, water and nutrients with native species. This prevents the native species from establishing or even surviving.&nbsp;

Invasive species management is labour-intensive and needs to be sustained regularly.&nbsp;

This programme will provide participants an opportunity to support National Parks Board staff in the removal of invasive species. They will also be equipped with information on trail etiquette and various invasive plant species, and on how to effectively remove weeds.&nbsp;

Participants are required to wear covered shoes and prepare their own pair of gardening gloves.
