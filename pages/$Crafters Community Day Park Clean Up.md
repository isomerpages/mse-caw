**Date:** 29 June, 9:00 am - 11:00 am<br>
**Admission:** Free (registration required)<br>
**Venue:** Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park<br>
**Organiser:** The Rainbow Artisan

The Rainbow Artisan invites participants in their first clean-up activity in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, in support of ground-up environment efforts to improve cleanliness and create a positive living environment. 

Participants can borrow free litter-picking tools from the [CleanPod](https://www.publichygienecouncil.sg/resources/cleanpod) and will not need to bring their own equipment. This is a good activity for all to network and connect with each other and the environment.

Participants are recommended to bring along the following items for the activity:
- Hat/Cap
- Gloves
- Water bottle (Keep yourself hydrated)
- Mask
- Hand sanitiser
- Umbrella/Poncho (in case of light rain)
