Getting to Zero is an innovative card game that helps you learn about Singapore's energy options in a fun, multi-sensory and self-directed manner.

The workshop, a joint effort between Climate Action SG Alliance and the National Institute of Education’s Sustainability Learning Lab, will start with context setting by Ms Melissa Low, Chair of the Climate Action SG Alliance. 

Through gameplay, you will then be introduced to Singapore's various energy options, their relative impact on carbon emissions, and their economic trade-offs.

Challenge yourself and your friends to achieve net-zero emissions while efficiently managing financial resources – the player who manages to reduce the most carbon emissions while balancing the economy will win!  

This activity is open to families and those aged 13 and above.
