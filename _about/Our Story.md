Led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Go Green SG (formerly known as Climate Action Week) is a whole-of-nation movement to rally the community to take collective action towards a sustainable future for Singapore. It comprises a series of sustainability-related events and activities in July organised by our People, Public and Private (3P) partners.

This year, Go Green SG will take place from **12 June to 14 July 2024**. 

You can curate your own Go Green experiences, based on individual lifestyles, personal interests and goals. With many exciting activities (e.g. behind-the-scenes sustainability tours, exclusive learning journeys, events, workshops, school and youth activities, promotions and green challenges) organised by 3P partners to choose from, everyone can go green in your own way.

Letâ€™s work together in achieving our shared vision of a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore!
